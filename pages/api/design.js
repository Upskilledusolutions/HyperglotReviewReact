    info:["Lladró, the Spanish porcelain company, has been applying its unmatched expertise in porcelain for over 60 years. At the India Design Week, Lladró displayed its most innovative and cutting-edge porcelain, lighting, and timely classic masterpieces combining design with age-old craft techniques as an expression of emotion and diversity. The recently released Seasons Chandelier, Embraced by Jamie Hayon, the Fierce Portraits collection, the famed Origami Panther, and The Guest were a few notable designs presented at India Design 2023.","The Origami Panther Figurines are inspired by the Japanese art form of Origami. Moved by the striking features of the flamingos and their social bond with each other, the Flamingos Sculpture was designed to express these feelings of kinship and vibrancy in a contemporary and visually pleasing manner.","Mokuren Chandeliers were created by Lladro in collaboration with Japanese designer Naoto Fukasawa. The white magnolia tree, which stands for timeless bonds, as well as the breathtaking beauty of its flowers served as the inspiration for Fukasawa's artwork. Both Lladro and Fuasawa have combined their signature elements of design, and nature and the traditional Japanese craftsmanship, Kogei. The flowers themselves are handcrafted and black lacquered aluminium has been used to depict the intricacy of the branches of a magnolia tree.","According to the artist Jaime Hayon, his porcelain piece, Embraced, 'represents the concept of looking after yourself.' The Fierce Portraits collection references the traditional African Masks with a striking, modern and contemporary design. Again, nature is evoked with pieces depicting a tiger, a baboon, an owl, a mandrill, a buffalo, an antelope, and a lion. The Guest is another piece designed by Jaime Hayon and Lladro has invited artists from all over the world to personalize this distinctive character in their own artistic styles. One of the designs for The Guest collection was made by Chinese artist Kzeng Jiang, who presents a contemporary take on the cultural and historical artistic traditions of China. Spanish designer Ricardo Cavolo's iconic designs show his son in a mystical, vibrant world with stars, flowers, castles, mountains, and volcanoes."],
