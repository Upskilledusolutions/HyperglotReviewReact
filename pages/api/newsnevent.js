In doing so, she brings out the uncanny echoes between us and bodies of water, in the way that they can be imaged, heard, and understood. This mode of enquiry emerged from Sundar's experiences with undiagnosed chronic pain and the research that led to on the differences between medical visualisations in the East and the West. Sundar found holistic representations that account for the body's ebbs and flows to provide better insight into the mysteries of its functioning in comparison with the fragmentation of the body into parts and symptoms as is standard in Western medicine. “ What remains central, nevertheless, to Sundar's practice is an acknowledgment of the enigmas of the human body and bodies of water that remain ambiguous and impenetrable.”"],

Mukherjee's poignant reclamation of sight through intuition - replacing overt realism - suggests an unexpected but distinctive brand of late modernism in which individual perspective is prioritized through a vocabulary of motifs. Still, in some sense, the changing dichotomies of intimacy and distance that he explored in his practice were united in a kind of “indigenous modernism” through calligraphic techniques - and reveal his intention of maintaining an artistic and aesthetic approach even after he went blind, almost as if Mukherjee himself was preparing for total darkness in his search for the particularities of life through experience."],

Inspired by forms of the graphic novel and comic books, Mawlong's wood-cuts are sequential stories that unfold in narrative time even within a flattened, often dramatic cropping. A jagged and persistent darkness glitches in his wood-cuts. Rampant though it is, the inky blackness of his mise-en-scène compositions is interrupted by slivers of white, a kind of anti-space that reforms the dynamics of negative and positive space, creating an eternal, spectral appearance.

info:["Singh's solo exhibition 'Afterlife' will feature ethereal thread drawings, installations, and animations of architectural fragments from her (now defunct) family home as they fracture and unravel into entropy. Sumakshi Singh is an artist and academic based in New Delhi, who also enjoys working as an academic. She has taught at the Art Institute of Chicago, Oxford University, and Columbia University among others. Recently, Sumakshi designed the renowned windows for Hermès, India. She has mentored residencies for The Victoria and Albert Museum, TheWhyNotPlace 2010 and 2011, and curated for the Devi Art Foundation. She is the recipient of several awards, including the Asia Arts Future Game Changer award by the Asia Society in 2022 ( to honor artists for their significant contributions to contemporary art), the YFLO award (from the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry) for achievement in the arts in 2019, a Zegna Grant in 2009, an Illinois Arts Council Award in 2007 (in recognition of outstanding work and commitment within the arts) and the Richard H. Driehaus Foundation Award in 2005 (to support and encourage excellence, artistry, focus, direction, maturity, and originality in the visual arts). Singh's installations open up a rich, silent space, which lies just before the world solidified by our perceptions. Our everyday 'given' are often questioned as her work begins to dissolve familiar forms and intimate memories into insubstantial mirages.","Afterlife - In her artistic oeuvre, Sumakshi Singh reconfigures the familiar axes of experience by engineering illusions through line and trace. The concrete constitution of architectural facades dissolves into textile ephemera, creating a mise-en-scene of spectral architectonics. Now uninhabitable, the facades offer themselves as experiential maps, harking back to the artist's palpable memories of her ancestral home on 33 Link Road, Delhi. Settled into by her deceased grandparents and standing for almost 70 years, the house no longer feels familiar to the artist like it did when it was still occupied. Singh started to look at the house and its constituent objects, corridors, and surfaces anew, and replicated them in her work with dimensional exactitude. Mounted to scale in the gallery, the house breathes through its simulation, attesting to an intense artistic need for perusal, absorption, and ultimately, surrender. The installations are created using thread of different kinds, levitating with wires to achieve the intended effect. Shadows are cast on the walls both naturally (against interior light sources) and through textile doubling, which further confounds vision. In contrast to Singh's installations in pre-Covid times, these works reveal a distinct sense of unravelling. Departing from the defined and measured contours of her earlier hand, Singh's concentrated experience of vulnerability, fear, and grieving during the pervasive malaise over the past two years percolated into her artistic sensibility. The threadwork on display then becomes, in Singh's words, a “transitional tapestry”, situated in the collisions of time, space, and memory. Through its recreations in embroidery, the house becomes a sentient archive. Memory is externalised and transferred to a material placeholder in thread, which activates the contours of a habitat on the brink of collapse. Scheduled to be sold or demolished in the near future, the house shifts anchors through Singh's work, reflecting her labour in processing a future past."],

She mocks the hypocrisy of traditions which exclude women from their homes during their menstrual cycles because they are viewed as dirty while cow dung cakes are used as fuel and in religious ceremonies to purify oneself since it is deemed pure.","For millennia, Indian miniatures have consistently portrayed sensual forms and varied facets of nudity, especially when incorporated into the history and narrative of a nation or culture. She was rejected from a museum exhibition where the exclusion of a budding young artist was justified by the nudity in her works.

She is an artist as well as a patron and collector of modern art and encourages emerging artists by providing a forum for dialogue and engagement. Since its debut, Dhi has collaborated with new and up-and-coming contemporary artists and has sparked numerous discussions on Indian art practices. Dhi Collective, an intervention outside the white cube space that serves as an incubator for debates, is the result of the gallery's efforts to stimulate creative and intercultural expression. Dhi hosts its annual artist residency as well as workshops, seminars, and mentorship programmes throughout the year. It is connected to a network of artists, curators, scholars, and art fans.","This year, Dhi Artspace is showcasing the works of four emerging contemporary artists whose inspiration comes from the discipline of visual storytelling. While Leena Raj chooses to translate popular proverbs from Malayalam onto her canvases, Poorvesh Patel uses rusted copper wires as a medium to revisit his early memories of farming in Gujarat, and Sumana Som stitches pieces of her personal history and life together in one plane. Arjun Das iterates the story of workers in Kolkata's Bara Bazar in his compositions. The artists use a variety of media while reflecting on their socio-cultural identities to start discussions about urbanisation, migration, labour, and the environment.","Arjun Das - Arjun recounts the struggles of the immigrant working class in Kolkata and makes mention of the lives of young labourers who were forced to forgo their elementary education in order to start over in the city, an 'imagined' paradise. He reacts to the interiority of a displaced laborer's daily existence using a wide range of dialogues with the workers in Bara Bazar, Kolkata, together with his experiences as a young immigrant in the city. In his most recent works, Arjun expands on his earlier explorations of wood to include fresh inquiries into metal, stone, coal, terracotta roof tiles, and asphalt—all essential components of the city worker's daily life.","Leena Raj - Leena views the typical conception of a home as a constrained area of homogenised identities and broadens the idea of a person's home beyond the defined space of four walls. According to her, a home is made up of diverse lives brought about by the affectionate companionship or the incongruities of unfamiliarity in the relationships of its other residents. She searches for a place to call home in all directions and, as she shows her fondness for diverse microcosms, creates fantastical landscapes in which people coexist peacefully with the natural world.","Poorvesh Patel - Poorvesh's colour scheme serves as the protagonist in his works, which are amplified accounts of his personal adventures. Through his works, his emotional behaviour interacts with the current socio-political environment. He uses examples from his everyday life to help create a mental image, and compares it to his subconscious. That idea is omnipresent in his workflow. “It is like seeing another life after a loss. It is like the phoenix having a rebirth every time.”","Sumana Som - Sumona engages in the practice of cartography, examining the aesthetics of visual representation while incorporating elements from Indian miniature painting traditions into her creations. She primarily uses textiles and manipulates the spatial relationships between her subjects to build layered narratives that unite the past and present in a single frame. Sumana addresses the intricate relationships between distance, boundary, ownership, encroachment, and power structures that permeate our daily lives through her endeavour."],

The red dots, which were adorned on each of the panels, created a sense of sacred aura that one would experience in a temple. One of the most interesting aspects of Adil Writer's work was the use of burnt wood beneath the panels. This was a deliberate decision, as he wanted to create a visual interplay between negative spaces and positive spaces. The burnt wood added an element of depth and contrast to the panels, creating a mesmerizing effect. His work is a perfect blend of tradition and modernity, paying tribute to the rich heritage of Indian mythology and art. Adil Writer began his career as an architect, but his passion for ceramics led him to train at the Golden Bridge Pottery in Puducherry. He is currently a partner at Mandala Pottery in Auroville, where he creates both functional tableware and his own line of studio ceramics. Writer's creations have been exhibited in several solo and group exhibitions around the world. He is a member of the International Academy of Ceramics in Geneva, a testament to his standing in the field of ceramic art."],

  info:["The 'Of Divergent Practice: The Trajectory of Printmakers' exhibition at Dhoomimal Gallery, curated by Ina Puri and designed by Reha Sodhi, aims to highlight the significance of printmaking and draw in more participation from younger artists. The exhibit features works by the founding members of 'Multiple Encounters' and veteran artists who served as their mentors. The showcased prints range from non-representational to simple aesthetics inspired by Japanese space and abstraction. 'Multiple Encounters' was formed in 2000 by seven printmakers, who aimed to popularize the medium and bring in more young artists. They recalled working at Garhi Studios with senior painters like Jagdish Swaminathan, Manjit Bawa, and Krishen Khanna, when they decided to form a group called the Indian Printmakers Guild in 1990. Later, a splinter group teamed up with seven artists who continued to work together and presented their first show titled 'Multiple Encounters'. The exhibit showcases recent works by each artist, including Kavita Nayar's sensual and fragile pieces and Dattatraya Apte's impressions of textures created by thirsty earth. Anandamoy Banerji, Sushanta Guha, and Moti Zharotia's works grapple with themes of violence, social issues, and surreal landscapes respectively. The exhibition is critical as it offers viewers a glimpse of valuable prints from different practitioners of the medium, from times past to present, and presents the trajectory of printmaking. The exhibit sheds light on the challenges faced by printmakers as they depended on the art market and collectors. Nevertheless, the artists persisted and exhibited in their individual capacities until the opportunity arose to showcase their works and Dhoomimal Gallery's archival collection. The 'Of Divergent Practice: The Trajectory of Printmakers' exhibition is a must-visit for art enthusiasts and aspiring printmakers as it provides an in-depth perspective on the medium and its evolution over the years."],

  info:["Meticulousness in deep aesthetical deliberations and precision in execution make the paintings of Padmanabh Bendre done between 2015 and 2017 appealing to the viewers. Bendre takes his inspiration from the Op Art Style that became a highly sought after art lingua during the 1960s as it heralded the arrival of other conceptual art practices. In more than one sense, the style of Bendre has the vibrancy of a conceptual artist who divides the pictorial plane with lines and grids capable of creating illusionary perspectives and movements. His aesthetical approach also implies its rootedness to Neo-Impressionistic language which is popularly known as Pointillism. However, Bendre brings his two dimensional pictorial surfaces to life by giving them an extra edge of abstraction. The more one goes beyond the illusionism that the paintings impart the more one comes to see and experience the minute notes of movement that together makes an ensemble of a galaxies of its own. Bendre trusts symmetry, order and harmony, often seen in the ritualistic repetition of traditional and folk arts that are at times adopted and polished to make classical art forms. The patterns thus formed seem to give him an immense of sense of satisfaction. But the artistic quirkiness pitches in when he decides to break the symmetry suddenly and attribute the whole structure with a methodical imbalance and unpredictable dynamics.","A sensible and sensitive viewer could discern the path of Bendre's journey to the Op-based conceptual paintings while looking at the works done between 2008 and 2015. He makes various sojourns in the beautiful landscapes of varying aesthetical affinities. The works done since 2008 exemplify Bendre's interest in experimenting with Expressionism, Abstraction and Neo-Impressionism. He is expressionistic while dealing with the most malleable form of Lord Ganesh. Without losing the cuteness, verve and sanctity of the image, using various hues, he builds up the physical shape of the godhead, as if it were a supreme abstract form, irrespective of the medium. At the same time one could locate the origins of his working towards the Op-based paintings. In this series, the grids are not visible and defined as seen in the aforementioned works. Rather, Bendre seems to be interested in abstracting the definite forms such as landscapes, cityscapes and other complex physical forms, exactly the way we see in the works of early Ram Kumar and S.H.Raza. As one moves forward, a series done in 2013-14 comes to the fore; image based abstractions, where Bendre seems to be experimenting with discernable forms such as flowers, butterflies and so on through controlled brushstrokes layered with free-dripping colors. He makes a statement regarding the artistic liberty by juxtaposing the improbable treatment of brushstrokes.","Bendre's latest series of paintings done in 2023 stand out because they bring forth the symphonic climaxing of a visual ensemble that the viewers have been treated with hitherto. The works could be largely described as paintings belonging to the Neo-Tantric Internationalist art movement. For the artists who had been the flagbearers of this style, abstracting the obvious and letting the resultant formations apparent were great achievements. However, Bendre walks an untrodden path; his geometrical approach is basically different from that of the pioneers. He, through his geometrical tools and methods vivisects and deconstructs the fundamental form and constructs harmonious symmetries that come to hold the universal forms that are explained philosophically and spiritually by the viewers and experts. Resultant images of such vivisection frame the works in a specialized kaleidoscopic visual zone, giving them a four sided orientation, suggesting the four faces, four directions, four time zones and four eons narrated in different contexts in the Indian philosophy."],
